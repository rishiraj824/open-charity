# Open Charity Drupal Theme

Open Charity is a single-page theme with simple and responsive design.

###Approach###

The theme is independent of any framework (Bootstrap, Foundation etc). 
The approach towards the theme has been to apply percentage and 
width : calc(); properties to maintain the grid like framework.
Other than than it follows a basic 'section' wise architechture which maintains the 
sites' backbone. The font used is MuseoSans, with weights 500 and 700. The body font
used is OpenSans which is fetched from Google Fonts link. The carousel used is [Owl Carousel](owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/).
